This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` function might not fire as expected if the app is launched directly from a deep link, rather than already being open and then receiving a deep link. This can lead to your app not processing the URL correctly.  For example, let's say your app is designed to open a specific screen based on the URL.  If the app is launched via the URL, the listener might not be triggered, so the screen won't open.
